# Song Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a **Song Recommendation System** using Python. The system leverages machine learning techniques to recommend songs based on user preferences and metadata. The core of the project is the Jupyter Notebook file `main.ipynb`.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Handles missing values and cleans the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gains insights into the dataset and user preferences.
- Recommendation model: Utilizes similarity metrics and collaborative filtering.
- Evaluation: Measures the performance of the recommendation system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kayo09/projects.git
   cd projects/Song%20Recommendation%20System
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset

The system uses a dataset containing metadata and user interaction data for songs. Ensure the dataset file is placed in the correct directory (e.g., `data/`) before running the notebook. Update the file paths in the notebook accordingly.

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `main.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Train the recommendation model
   - Evaluate the results

### Outputs

- Visualizations for dataset insights and trends.
- Recommended songs based on user preferences.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the recommendation system.
